// This src/index.js file is the main entry into the React application.  It does
// not contain much application code, instead it is mostly boilerplate code that
// wires up some of the features we want to add to our React application.
//
// When getting started, the most important piece is the line that contains:
//   <Route path="/" component={AppContainer}/>
// which specifies that the root of the application is to be AppContainer which
// can be found in containers/AppContainer.js.  The rest of the application gets
// included as descendants of that component.
//
// The rest of the code below is doing things like setting up a client-side
// router that allows us to define multiple routes and pages all on the
// client-side.  We also setup a redux store, which is a strategy we use for
// storing and organizing the state of the application.  Finally we configure
// the application to support hot module reloading (hmr), which means we can
// update code in our editor and see changes in the browser without refreshing
// the page.

// Create the history instance that enables client-side application routing.
const history = createHashHistory();

// Create the redux store with the configureStore helper found in redux/store.js
const store = configureStore(history);

  <Provider store={store}>
